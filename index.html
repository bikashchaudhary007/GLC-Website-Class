    <p>Based on my findings, GLC Educational Hub appears to be an educational institution located in Kathmandu, Nepal. Here's what I could gather:
        <br>
        <b style="font-size: 30px;">Location and Hours:</b>
        <br>
        <hr>
        It's situated in Kathmandu and their hours are 6 AM to 7 PM, Tuesday through Monday.
        * **Positive Reviews:**  They have a perfect rating (5.0 stars) on Google based on 12 reviews, which suggests it's a well-regarded establishment.
        * **Social Media Presence:** They have a TikTok account [@glc.education.hub] but without much detail on what services they offer. 
        
        Unfortunately, beyond that, there isn't much information publicly available online.  However, given it's an educational hub, they likely offer various educational services or courses. 
        
        Here are some suggestions for further research:
        
        * Visit their social media (TikTok) and see if they have any links in their profile description. 
        * Call them directly at 986-4410283 to inquire about their offerings.
